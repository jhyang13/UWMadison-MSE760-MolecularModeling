### Lab1-Assignment

This lab project focuses on determining the electronic structure and lattice constant of fcc diamond, as part of MSE760. The tasks include:
- Building the diamond structure (similar to fcc silicon but with a different lattice constant).
- Achieving total energy convergence with respect to k-points and wavefunction cutoff, using norm-conserving pseudopotentials.
- Optimizing the lattice constant by fitting the total energy to the Murnaghan equation of state.
- Optionally optimizing the lattice constant using varicell optimization.
- Comparing the lattice constant with experimental results.
- Computing and analyzing the band structure and density of states, and comparing with experimental data.
- Writing a detailed lab report that includes abstract, methods, results, discussion, and conclusionsâ€‹(lab1-diamond).
