Here we introduce the phonon code. A calculation of the vibrational 
frequencies of Si at the gamma point is shown. The calculation of the 
electronic dielectric constant is also shown. Discussion of the input variables
and of the output variables. Description of the dynamical matrix file.
We discuss the importance of the acoustic sum rules.
We sho how to perform a phonon calculation at a point different from gamma.
